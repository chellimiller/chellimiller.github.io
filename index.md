<p>
I'm a software engineer from Tempe, Arizona, specializing in TypeScript, React, and backend development.
</p>

<p>
I'm dedicated to writing high-quality, maintainable code,
with a strong belief in automated testing and best practices to enhance efficiency and reliability.
Accessibility in software is one of my core values.

<p>
Team dynamics is something I'm passionate about, since the team's culture drives results more than anything else.
It's rewarding to work alongside collaborative, driven individuals,
with each of us bringing our own unique skills and perspectives to the table.

Reach out on LinkedIn if you're interested in discussing tech or exchanging ideas.
I'm always eager to learn from others and share what I've picked up along the way!
