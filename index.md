<p>
I'm a software engineer based in Tempe, Arizona.
I specialize in TypeScript, React, automated testing, accessibility, and backend development.
I'm deeply committed to continuous learning and writing high-quality, user-focused software.
</p>

<p>
Writing clean, maintainable code is a philosophy that guides every project I undertake.
I've found that high-quality code ships faster and that automation is the key to success.
This has grown my passion for automated testing, static analysis, and solid CI/CD processes.
</p>

<p>
Software is for people, so I place a high value in user experience.
Knowing people with different accessibility needs has shaped my commitment to both accessibility and localization.
