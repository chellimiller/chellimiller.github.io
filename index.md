<p>
I'm a software engineer based in Tempe, Arizona with a focus in TypeScript, React, and backend development.
I'm passionate about learning and finding better ways to write maintainable, user-friendly software.
My journey has led me to appreciate the importance of automated testing, accessibility, and thoughtful, maintainable code.

<p>
In my experience, quality code not only makes development smoother but also results in faster delivery.
I'm a fan of automated testing and solid CI/CD practices because they help my team and I work more effectively.
Seeing the impact that a collaborative, well-functioning team makes is an incredibly rewarding experience.
</p>

<p>
I believe software should be accessible to everyone.
My experiences with people who have diverse accessibility needs have made me more aware and committed to inclusive design.
It's about making sure everyone can benefit from the technology we build.
